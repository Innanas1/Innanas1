- 👋 Hi, I’m @Innanas1
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and some coding. I understand HTML, CSS, and JAVA.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use AI prompts. The many uses of coding co-creating with AI is also very interesting. It helps with the multi- tasking when using the right tools. This does not replace collaborators, it only speeds things up on my user side a bit. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the universe and beyond.
- 📫 How to reach me the obvious ways. 
- 😄 Pronouns: me, myself, and I
- ⚡ Fun fact: 😁 What did the Mushroom say to the bartender? You're not a fun guy.
